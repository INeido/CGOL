A Conway's Game of Life implementation using numpy and pygame.

## Description

This project has no particular aim. It is a purely personal project and barely maintained.

It is a CLI based [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation using numpy for fast calculations and pygame for an interactive simulation.

No Hashlife or Quicklife algorithm support (yet).

---

Rules of Conway's Game of Life
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Installing

Install using pip
```bash
pip install cgol
```

Manually install using CLI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/INeido/CGOL
pip install -e CGOL/.
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter any errors during the installation process, consider the following options:

If pip is not found you can try to access it using 
```bash
python -m pip
```
or install it using
```bash
python -m ensurepip
```

You can attempt to install using pipx, a tool designed for running Python applications in isolated environments
```bash
pipx install cgol
```

If issues persist, create a virtual environment and install within it for a clean and isolated setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install cgol
```

## Usage

NOTE: If you installed using pipx you might have to run `pipx ensurepath` once or prepend `pipx run` to the example commands below.

Here are some examples.

Start a simulation with the default setting but with a custom seed.
```bash
cgol -se 42
```

Change grid size, cell size and fade color.
```bash
cgol -cf 130 20 0 -cs 8 -gh 90 -gw 160
```
![](https://github.com/INeido/CGOL/blob/main/samples/demo2.gif?raw=true)

Change the color to white on black without fade.
```bash
cgol -fa False -ca 255 255 255
```

Draw with the mouse to birth or kill cells.
